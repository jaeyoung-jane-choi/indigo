#### Abstract
Recently due to the development in machine learning and deep learning, applications of these technologies have been widely utilized daily and industrially.
Implementations of machine learning on finance data have been in interest as well.
Herein, we apply machine learning algorithms onto store sales data and present future applications for Fintech industries. 
We consider various missing data processing methods and utilize gradient boosting machine learning algorithms: XGBoost,
LightGBM, CatBoost to predict the future sales for individual stores. 
As a result, we found that using simple median imputation with a XGBoost model has the best accuracy. 
By employing the proposed method, stores which have low credibility but have high probability to compensate for repayment can benefit by receiving assistance beforehand,
while Fintech enterprises can benefit by offering financial instruments to these stores.. [더 읽어보기](https://github.com/jaeyoung-jane-choi/papers/blob/main/Short_ENG_Store_sales_prediction.pdf)
