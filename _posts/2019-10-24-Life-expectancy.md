#### Introduction
Life expectancy is the average period a person is expected to live if the death rate the year they were born is
stable. Normally, life expectancy is used to measure how long a person can live in a particular country and it is
most associated with the health of individuals. Prior studies have found that there is a relationship between life
expectancy and income per person. The income per person is the average income a person earns in a particular
period. Normally, it is measured with the gross domestic product (GDP) and the amount of national production
in a period. In this project, we want to learn about the relationship between life expectancy and income per
person. In particular, we are interested in this relationship since World War 2 (WW2). We used the Gapminder
website (www.gapminder.org/data) to collect information about life expectancy per country, inflation-adjusted
income per person through the GDP per capita, and the total population of countries from 1800 until 2018. [Read more here](https://github.com/jaeyoung-jane-choi/papers/blob/main/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Life-expectancy-and-its-relationship-to-income.pdf)
