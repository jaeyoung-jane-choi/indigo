#### Abstract


In the US, 40% of the adult population is obese, becoming a health burden. Obesity is related to different diseases and poor mental health. However, there are inconsistencies about the relationship between Obesity and poor mental health. The objective of this project to determine the association between obesity and outpatient mental health treatment and which covariates might influence it, using the NSDUH dataset. A weighted logistic model adjusted with a loess and glm regression line was done to determine the relationship between obesity and outpatient mental health treatment without covariates. Then, different additive models and model with interaction were done to determine which of those covariates influence the association. Finally, a weighted logistic model considering those covariates and the odds ratio was calculated. As a result, BMI and outpatient mental health treatment relationships without covariates indicate obesity paradox. Covariates as alcohol consumption, education level, and income strata seem to influence the association. The weighted logistic model adjusted with the covariates shows that as BMI increases the risk of outpatient mental health treatment also increases. However, the odds ratios indicate no association between BMI and the risk of outpatient mental health treatment. More research and exploratory data analysis are required.
