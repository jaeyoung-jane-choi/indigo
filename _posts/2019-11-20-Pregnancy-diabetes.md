#### Background

In this study I analyzed diabetes test results of 768 adult
female Pima Indians living near Phoenix to answer the
following question:

• Does the diabetes test result differ depending on number
of pregnancy of the woman?

• I hypothesized that the test result is different by
pregnancy number:

• H0: There is no difference in average number of
times pregnant between group with diabetes and
group not having diabetes.
• H1: There is difference in average number of times
pregnant between group with and without diabetes.

• Previous studies have found that diabetes affect
pregnancy : Can it be oppositely said that, the number of pregnancy affects diabetes?
