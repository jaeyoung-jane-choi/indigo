<p>I’m currently an undergraduate at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. I have a B.A in Library and Information Science and a B.S in Data Analytics. </p>

<p>I’m interested in machine learning, deep learning, recommendation systems and natural language processing. 
Specifically, I am fascinated with the underlying concept of embeddings for nlp, graphs and anything else that is interesting! </p>
