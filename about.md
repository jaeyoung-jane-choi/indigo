<p>I’m currently an undergraduate at Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul, South Korea. I have a B.A in Library and Information Science and a B.S in Data Analytics. </p>

<p>I’m interested in informatics, machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing. 
	My primary research interests revolve around adapting technical methods for and applying them todigital humanities practices.  More specifically, these interests entail unearthing innovative ways of digitizing artifacts and thereby bridging technology and various fields within the humanities (e.g., history and literature).  </p>
